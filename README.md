## Hi, I'm Elvis! 👋

- 🔭 I'm an Indie Developer and Content Creator on [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bissash05) that likes to turn ideas into pixels on the screen.
- 🕹️ I do Game Development on Godot Engine and Unity Engine. Currently working on my first comercial development [The Kindred](https://elvisvilla.itch.io/soul-godot-engine)

- 🌱 Currently learning on iOS Development, and making Project Studio, my re-imagination of a Productivity App for Personal Projects that keeps you focus on what matters.
